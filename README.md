# product_reservation_tool
## Description 
You want to create a program for reserving products. Your code will be used by a front-end (UI) that you donâ€™t know and
you will implement the back-end.

## Pre-requisites
![You must implement the classes of the two following interfaces](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22653887/198223323-42f0d056-5f43-44df-8991-db53ea4cf856.png)
![Here is an example of data definitions](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22653887/198223442-d8cd5e06-6109-4dc6-9d44-0404654cf754.png)

## Rules 
- The identifiers must be unique
- The client can make reservations even if the product is out-of-stock
- The reservations must be FIFO
- A product can only be ordered once within the same reservation
- It is not possible to order an unknown product
- A reservation is available only if the inventory has enough products
